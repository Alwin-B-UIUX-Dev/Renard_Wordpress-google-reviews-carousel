# Google Reviews Carousel (WORK IN PROGRESS)

This WordPress plugin dynamically displays Google reviews for a business using a shortcode, as a carousel or list.  
It’s easy to configure, featuring an admin settings page for your Google API key and Google Place ID.

## Features

- Automatically fetches Google reviews for a specified Place ID
- Smart caching (1 hour) to avoid hitting Google’s API limits
- Simple shortcode to display reviews anywhere on your site
- Admin options page for entering API key and Place ID
- Built following WordPress coding and security standards
- **Well-documented and commented code**

## Usage

1. Install the plugin to your WordPress site (`wp-content/plugins/`)
2. Activate it from the WordPress admin
3. Go to the plugin settings page (Settings > Google Reviews Carousel)
4. Enter your Google API Key and your Place ID (find these in the Google Places platform)
5. Use the shortcode:  

[grc_google_reviews]

Place it on any page, post, or widget to display your reviews

## Limitations / Roadmap

⚠️ **This plugin is a work in progress!**
- Basic display for now (carousel or list)
- More appearance and filtering options coming soon (star filter, number of reviews, manual cache refresh, etc.)
- Planned: Multisite support, improved error handling, export options, and more
